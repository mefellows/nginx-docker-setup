## Configure a proxy that will handle your requests, and forward
## to proxied host.
##
## Currently supports `tcp_proxy` and `http_proxy`.
proxy:

  ## HTTP Proxy: Configures an HTTP Proxy
  ##
  ## NOTE: SSL is currently not supported
  - name: http_proxy
    config:
      host: 0.0.0.0

## Middleware
##
## Middleware are plugins that are given the opportunity to intervene
## before a request is dispatched to the proxied system (PRE_DISPATCH event)
## and afterwards (POST_DISPATCH event). They are given a reference to
## the current context (HTTP Context or []bytes) and can mutate them.
##
## Middleware are executed in the order specified in this config.

middleware:

  ## Request Logger - use this to see what's going in/out of the Proxy.
